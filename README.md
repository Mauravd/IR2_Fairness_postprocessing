# IR2_Fairness_postprocessing

FOE code based on: https://github.com/arezooSarvi/OMIT_Fair_ranking 
ListNet + FOE: the outlier part is removed here. Also the part for DIC and DPC
BM25 + FOE: here FOE code is slightly changed from the original code. The candidates are not used anymore, but a ranking in form of a dictionary.
